Raspberry Stats
===============

This is a simple a project that I made using NodeJS, Socket.io and Highcharts.

!!DISCLAIMER!! 

Hey there! Thanks for reading/using/editing this code, I just wanted to say a couple of things :

First of all this code isn't at it's best because I did a rather bad job at using some of the API's possibilities.

Second of all, I'm a fifteen year developer at the making of this code so I'm not so experienced in a general sense.

 
If you make any improvements to the code, email me your forked github repository of this code and I'll take a look at it just to learn :)

 
You can also email me at : 96aa48 [at] gmail.com

 
Thanks !

Dependencies :
==============

The code depends on the following : Socket.io and Connect (Node).
You can install them using NPM with the following commands :

	npm install socket.io
	npm install connect
